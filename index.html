<h2>Introduction</h2>
 <p> </p>
Describes the main question that you are asking in your project. It should describe the problem that you are taking on that builds on the paper. For example, you can try seeing if the method in the paper can be applied to some new data, or you can measure or visualize the methods of the paper in your own way that varies from what was done in the paper. Or you investigate whether it is possible to build a new application or new method that incorporates or extends the work in the paper. You should keep it simple: it is just a short project.

<h2>Paper Review</h2>
<p>
 This paper introduces FunSearch, an LLM-based approach to tackling challenging mathematical and combinatorial problems. FunSearch iteratively evolves programs via suggestions from the LLM; a distributed system comprised of three types of workers is used to store initial user-provided programs and those generated during the evolutionary process (programs database), query the database for prompts to guide the LLM’s generation of new programs (samplers), and finally assess the generated programs’ performance by executing them on inputs of interest and providing feedback (evaluators). 
</p>
 <p>
  The algorithm skeleton provided by FunSearch serves as a template for program evolution and is demonstrated in this paper on two different problem domains: cap set construction and online bin packing. Researchers found that in the cap set problem, FunSearch was able to exceed traditional methods by discovering larger cap sets in higher dimensions where brute-force approaches were impractical. Similarly, in the online bin packing problem, FunSearch was able to outperform traditional heuristics by evolving more effective packing strategies. Overall, FunSearch offers scalability, flexibility, and enhanced performance over existing approaches, showcasing its potential to address a wide range of challenging optimization problems. Thus, we hope to extend on this research by applying FunSearch to the online bin packing problem and evaluating the scores. 
 </p>
<h2>Method</h2>
describes the technical structure of your method or implementation. This should be brief, no more than one screenful of webpage text.  You may also include an architectural figure in addition to the text.. Include a pointer to the code to your implementation.

<h2>Findings</h2>
reports your experimental findings. This should include graphs or images that visualize the results that you have obtained. Ideally this will compare your method to some simpler approach (this is called a “baseline” comparison), and/or it should compare your method to a simpler version of your method (this is called an “ablation”).

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
one paragraph to summarize your conclusions, including any implications for applications or impacts on society, or ideas for future work.

<h2>References</h2>
bibliography at the bottom, where you have cited the main paper that you read, plus any other citations that you’ve taken as inspiration or otherwise mentioned in your project.
