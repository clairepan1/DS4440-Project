<h2> An Analysis of "Mathematical Discoveries From Program Search With Large Language Models"</h2>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
 <p> In this project, we aim to explore the applicability and extend the findings of the paper "FunSearch: Leveraging LLMs for Evolving Programs to Solve Mathematical and Combinatorial Problems." Our objective is to investigate methods to improve the algorithm's effectiveness in tackling the online bin packing problem and the cap set problem, which are both challenges that were originally addressed in the paper but presents opportunities for further optimization and refinement.
 </p>
 
 <p>
Building upon the foundation laid out in the paper, our project seeks to evaluate algorithm performance on these two problems and compare it against traditional heuristic methods. We hope to extend the methodology presented in the paper by exploring the impact of various parameters, such as the number of islands and iterations. Specifically, we will measure how altering these parameters affects the size of cap sets discovered. 
</p>
<p> 
To achieve these objectives, we have implemented the FunSearch algorithm, reproduced the experiments outlined in the paper, and extended our investigations by introducing new experiments with varying parameters. We have also developed a pipeline to collect and analyze data, enabling us to generate graphs that depict the relationship between scores and samples across different experimental setups.
 </p>
 <p> 
By addressing these questions, we aim to not only validate the effectiveness of FunSearch in these domains, but also provide insights into the robustness and scalability of its algorithmic framework. Ultimately, our project aims to contribute to the ongoing research in evolutionary algorithms and their applications in solving complex optimization problems.
 </p>

Main question:

How does changing the number of islands in this genetic programming algorithm affect the evolution and success of its outputs?

How do different LLMs(and thus different code mutators) affect the success of FunSearch outputs?

<h2>Paper Review</h2>
<p>
 This paper introduces FunSearch, an LLM-based approach to tackling challenging mathematical and combinatorial problems. FunSearch iteratively evolves programs via suggestions from the LLM; a distributed system comprised of three types of workers is used to store initial user-provided programs and those generated during the evolutionary process (programs database), query the database for prompts to guide the generation of new programs (samplers), and finally assess the generated program performance by executing them on inputs of interest and providing feedback (evaluators).

 <p>
  The algorithm skeleton provided by FunSearch serves as a template for program evolution and is demonstrated in this paper on two different problem domains: cap set construction and online bin packing. Researchers found that in the cap set problem, FunSearch was able to exceed traditional methods by discovering larger cap sets in higher dimensions where brute-force approaches were impractical. Similarly, in the online bin packing problem, FunSearch was able to outperform traditional heuristics by evolving more effective packing strategies. Overall, FunSearch offers scalability, flexibility, and enhanced performance over existing approaches, showcasing its potential to address a wide range of challenging optimization problems. Thus, we hope to extend on this research by applying FunSearch to the online bin packing problem and evaluating the scores. 
 </p>

 
<h2>Method</h2>

<p>
  In order to implement FunSearch, we first connected to OpenAI 3.5 Turbo via their API and registered for a key with $5 worth of credits.  For generating capset solutions,  LLMs are prompted in the form of: 

  </p>
  <center><img class="implement" src = 'images/Prompt1.png' ></center>
  <center><img class="implement" src='images/Prompt2.png'> </center>

<p>
The returned code is then run in a Docker sandbox(developed by jonppe on Github) and the performance of the solution evaluated.  This is where we extended the implementation of the original funsearch paper, by examining the # of islands as a hyperparameter upon which we can perform a search. 

<center><img class = "implement" src = "images/Analyse Implementation.png"> </center>

Here, we injected a file readout from the sandbox run and added the program to the program database. This allows us to further examine the performance and behavior of programs generated with different islands as a hyperparameter.


</p>

<h2>Findings</h2>

<p>
  Our findings indicate that the number of islands in the genetic programming algorithm has a significant impact on the evolution and success of its outputs. Specifically, we observed that increasing the number of islands led to a more diverse set of programs being generated, which in turn increased the likelihood of discovering high-performing solutions. This suggests that the algorithm benefits from a higher degree of exploration in the search space, which is facilitated by the parallelism introduced by multiple islands.
  However, increasing the number of islands also drives up computation costs and # of API calls in total.

  In order to account for this, we limited the number of "samples" (API calls) to under 100.  Thus, 4 experiments were run with this in mind, with the number of islands increasing to a higher multiple of 5 each time.

    <div class="grid-item"><img class='implement' src="images/15 Islands.png"></div>
  </div>
  
  We found an 10 islands to be optimal, as this creates a larger spread of diversity while providing each island with an adequate number of iterations for advancing evolution of programs.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
In conclusion, our project extends the applicability of the FunSearch algorithm, as outlined in the paper 'Mathematical Discoveries From Program Search With Large Language Models.' By focusing on the online bin packing problem and the cap set problem, we aimed to enhance the algorithm's effectiveness. Through our experimentation, we observed that the number of islands in the genetic programming algorithm significantly influences the evolution and success of its outputs. We found that increasing the number of islands leads to a more diverse set of programs, improving the likelihood of discovering high-performing solutions. However, this also escalates computation costs and the number of API calls. Our findings suggest that striking a balance, such as with 10 islands, optimizes performance while managing resources effectively. These insights contribute to the ongoing research in evolutionary algorithms and offer potential applications in solving complex optimization problems. Future work could explore additional parameters and refine the algorithm further for broader real-world applications.
